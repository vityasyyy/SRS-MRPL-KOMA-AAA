\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose}
The purpose of this document is to present a detailed description of the functional
and non-functional requirements for the Furniture Selling Web Based Application.
It will also explain the app constraints, interface, and interactions with each services.
This document is intended for both the stakeholders and the developers
for a reference of developing the first version of the application.

\section{Project Scope}
AAA Furnitures is a web-based application that allows the customers of AAA Furnitures 
to purchase furnitures online. The application will allow the customers 
to browse the available furnitures, add them to the cart,
make secure payments, and track the delivery of the purchased items.
The application will also allow the admin to manage the products displayed on the website 
and the orders made by the customers.
The system will consist of multiple microservices, including the auth service, product service,
the order service, the payment service, and the delivery service.

\chapter{Overall Description}

\section{Product Perspective}
This product is a new e-commerce platform designed as a microservices-based system. 
It aims to provide a comprehensive online shopping experience with user authentication,
product browsing, order management, payment processing, and delivery tracking capabilities.
The system is self-contained but designed with a modular architecture to allow for future expansion
and integration with third-party services such as payment gateways and shipping providers. 
The microservices architecture ensures that each component can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

The following figure \ref{fig:architecture} illustrates the high-level architecture of the system:

\chapter{External Interface Requirements}

\section{User Interfaces}
$<$Describe the logical characteristics of each interface between the software 
product and the users. This may include sample screen images, any GUI standards 
or product family style guides that are to be followed, screen layout 
constraints, standard buttons and functions (e.g., help) that will appear on 
every screen, keyboard shortcuts, error message display standards, and so on.  
Define the software components for which a user interface is needed. Details of 
the user interface design should be documented in a separate user interface 
specification.$>$

% Done
\section{Hardware Interfaces}
The catalog website and the admin dashboard do not depend on specific hardware components, and therefore, no direct hardware interfaces are required. All product-related data, including images, descriptions, and other relevant details, are managed within the web platform. Payment transactions are facilitated through direct communication via WhatsApp rather than a dedicated payment processing hardware.

The database server connection is handled by the underlying infrastructure provided by the hosting service, ensuring reliable data storage and retrieval for both visitors and administrators. This approach abstracts hardware dependencies, allowing the system to operate efficiently across various environments.

% Done
\section{Software Interfaces}
The catalog website interacts with various software components to ensure seamless functionality and efficient data management. It is developed using Next.js as the primary frontend framework, with Tailwind CSS for styling and responsive design. The backend is managed through Payload CMS, which facilitates content organization and retrieval.

The system utilizes Supabase (Vercel Postgres) as its primary database for storing product details, user interactions, and other relevant data. Additionally, Supabase storage is used to handle and serve product images, ensuring optimized retrieval and delivery. Communication between the frontend and backend occurs via API requests, allowing structured data exchange and synchronization.

For transactions, the website does not include an integrated payment gateway but instead facilitates purchases through direct WhatsApp messaging. Furthermore, third-party libraries and services are integrated for image optimization, SEO enhancements, and performance monitoring to improve user experience and website visibility.

Data sharing between software components follows an API-driven approach, ensuring security, consistency, and scalability. If required, additional implementation constraints, such as authentication mechanisms and rate limiting, can be applied to protect data integrity.

% Done
\section{Communications Interfaces}
The catalog website relies on standard web communication protocols to ensure seamless data exchange between the frontend, backend, and external services. The system primarily uses HTTPS for secure communication and is accessible through modern web browsers.

Data transactions between the frontend and backend are managed through GraphQL API provided by Payload CMS, allowing efficient retrieval and management of product information stored in Supabase (Vercel Postgres).

For customer inquiries via the Contact Us form, the system integrates with Google Sheets API to store submitted form data in a centralized Google Sheet. Additionally, Nodemailer is used to send email notifications based on form submissions, ensuring that administrators are promptly informed of customer inquiries.

To enhance the user experience, the website also integrates Google Maps API, which provides an interactive map displaying the warehouse location. This allows users to easily locate the company's physical store or storage facility.

Since transactions are conducted outside the platform via WhatsApp messaging, no payment gateway integration is required. WhatsApp's built-in encryption ensures secure communication between customers and the business.

To maintain data integrity and security, all API communications follow industry best practices, including authentication mechanisms, rate limiting, and encrypted data transmission where applicable.
